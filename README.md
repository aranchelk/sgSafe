##From S&G official docs:##

Observing the following rules will help you select a new combination
which is secure and which will optimize the design
strengths of your Sargent & Greenleaf lock.

2. Do not select numbers in an ascending or descending
sequence.

3. Leave at least a ten number margin between adjacent numbers
of the combination.

4. Do not use a number between 95 and 99 or between 0 and
20 for the third (or last) number of the combination. This
can cause a condition which will inhibit the mechanism
from locking correctly.
